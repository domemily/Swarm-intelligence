# Swarm-intelligence

Matlab codes for multi-agent system, swarm robotics, agent based modeling and simulation.

The matlab codes are some cases for multi-agent system, with particular focus on aggregation/segregation behaviors, group chase and escape behaviors, pursuit-evasion behaivors, multi-target trapping with swarm robots.

1. Multi-target trapping with swarm robots, see GRN_JIN_RBFs_statics.m and GRN_JIN_RBFs_dynamic.m
2. Aggregation and segregation behaviors, see SAC.m, SAC_split.m, SAC_split_1(2,3).m
3. Group chase and escape behaviors, see SAC_predation_energy_changing_run.m and SAC_predation_energy_changing_stay.m
4. Evolutionary behavior in group chase and escape, see GC_Evo.m
